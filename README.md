This repository is under the process of being rewritten. Stay tuned! You can
check the current progress at the
[roadmap](https://github.com/rr-/szurubooru/wiki/Roadmap).

The reasons behind this rewrite include:

- Improving user experience: better upload form, larger thumbnails, making top
  navigation stay out of user way. Maybe other goodies!
- Finally having good, well-documented REST API.
- Simplifying user registration.
- Replacing PHP with Python 3.5.
- Replacing prior JS mess with proper MVC.
- Replacing MySQL (MariaDB) with Postgres.
- Replacing `composer`, `npm`, `mod_rewrite` (=Apache), `imagick`, `ffmpeg` or
  `gnash` and `pdo_mysql` with just `pip`, `npm` and `ffmpeg`.
- Replacing `grunt` with `npm` scripts.
- Making hosting more flexible: offer simple self hosted application that can
  be combined with any reverse proxy.
